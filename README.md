## Projects:
### Fake News Detection

Natural Language Protcessing (NLP) Project is based on "Leaders Prize: Fact or Fake News?" Competition http://leadersprize.truenorthwaterloo.com

The project includes cleaning, exploration and visualiazation of data. In addition, the project implements various model such as Logistic Regression, Random Forrest, Naive Bayes and Convulation Neural Network to classify the news headline as either Fake, True and Partly True.

### Canada Federal Elections 2019 Sentiment Analysis

The goal of the project is to essentially use sentiment analysis on Twitter data to get insight into the 2019 Canadian elections.

The NLP project includes cleaning, exploration and visualization of data. The models are used in this project for two purposes:
1. Predicting sentiment of the tweet related to each party (Liberals, Convervative, NDP)
2. Classification of the tweets of negative sentiments to various categories

The features for the above is created using both Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF. The following models are implemented for the classificaiton:
- Logisitic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- KNN
- SVM
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XG Boost
- Convolutional Neural Network
