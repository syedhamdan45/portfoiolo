I am currently a Master of Engineering student at the University of Toronto pursuing the degree in Mechanical & Industrial Engineering with the emphasis in Data Analytics. I am seeking full-time work opportunity after I graduate in September 2020.

### Relevant Academic Courses:
- Foundation of Machine Learning and Data Analytics
- Introduction to Data Science and Analytics
- Decision Support Systems
- AI in Finance
- Financial Engineering
- Big Data Science


## Projects:

### Information Retrieval System

The dataset used in the project includes test collection which is about 4,000 documents from US Government web sites and the topics/query are 15 needs for government information. Both were part of the TREC conference in 2003. The aim of the project is to run Whoosh on a large document collection for certain queries and approve on the baseline model.

Three softwares used:
- Whoosh, a pure-Python search engineering library, 
- NLTK, a natural language processing toolkit and 
- pytrec eval, an Information Retrieval evaluation tool for Python, based  on the popular trec eval, the standard software for evaluating search engines with test collections.

### Fake News Detection

Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project is based on "Leaders Prize: Fact or Fake News?" Competition http://leadersprize.truenorthwaterloo.com

The project includes cleaning, exploration and visualiazation of data. In addition, the project implements various model such as Logistic Regression, Random Forrest, Naive Bayes and Convulation Neural Network to classify the news headline as either Fake, True and Partly True.

### Canada Federal Elections 2019 Sentiment Analysis

The goal of the project is to essentially use sentiment analysis on Twitter data to get insight into the 2019 Canadian elections.

The NLP project includes cleaning, exploration and visualization of data. The models are used in this project for two purposes:
1. Predicting sentiment of the tweet related to each party (Liberals, Convervative, NDP)
2. Classification of the tweets of negative sentiments to various categories

The features for the above is created using both Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF. The following models are implemented for the classificaiton:
- Logisitic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- KNN
- SVM
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XG Boost
- Convolutional Neural Network

### Data Scientists Salary Classification

Project to identify skills that are important for data scientists to posses based on salary level as a target variable. The goal is to identify skills and qualifications from the survey that are important to learn in data science field in order to have a high salary.
Dataset taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018/

The model includes data cleaning, visualization and exploration. The data exploration includes feature engineering and selection to ensure the best features are selected. The model implemented here is Logistic Regression-One Versus Rest Classifier- since there this is an ordinary multi class classification algorithm multiclass problem. Bias vs Variance trade-off is also discussed in the code.

### Linear Regression

Linear Regression model using different forms of Gradient Descent such as stochastic gradient descent and mini batch gradient descent on the classic Boston House dataset.

The code also uses two types of loss functions- Mean Squared Error Loss and Absolute Error loss. The code includes derivation of both types of loss functions and its implementation. The effect of learning rate is also explored.
